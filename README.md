# Horiseon Homepage Code Refactor

## Description

This webpage was created for the Horiseon Social Solution Services company to provide information for those interested in working with them. The Horiseon homepage was seeing issues with the navigation bar and accessibility elements such as alternate titles for images. As proper functionality and accessibility is important for any website in order to follow accessibility standards and be optimized for search engines, I fixed the issues with the navigation bar and added appropriate alternate titles to images. I also consolidated redundant CSS classes and elements to provide cleaner code. Finally, semantic HTML elements were added to better organize the HTML file and provide more meaning to each section.
